# Embedded & low level-friendly patterns in _no_std_ Rust
When viewing this [published as
slides]https://peter-kehl.github.io/no_std_rna_transcription_patterns_presentation):
 1. _Not_ for mobile devices/tiny screens. See a limited
    [alternative
    view](https://github.com/peter-kehl/embedded_low_level_rust/blob/main/README.md)
    instead.
 2. **Zoom out** (because the slides can't be scrolled down), until you see
    numbers shown down to 0 below.
 3. Prefer Firefox (better screen utilization than Chrome).
 4. Press `?` question mark to get a help screen.
 5. Press the bottom left button for a menu (with list of slides & themes).
 6. Press letter **`o`** (lowercase), or **`ESC`** key, to show (or hide) an
    **overview** of the nearby slides.
 7. Press **`Ctrl Shift F`** to show (or hide) a **search** input (at the top
    right). Type the text to search for and **Enter**. Click anywhere on the
    slide before using the keys to navigate again. This search is **sticky**:
    Any matching text will stay highlighted, even as you navigate to other
    slides. (It highlights any matches on the overview screen, too.)
